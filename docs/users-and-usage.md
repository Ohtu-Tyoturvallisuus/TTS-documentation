## Usage scenarios

### Foreman (start)

Before starting to build, modify, or dismantle a scaffolding, the foreman of the group starts filling out a hazard identification form.
They start by picking the corresponding project from the list, and choosing the necessary languages.
After this, they fill out the form by choosing whether a hazard is relevant or not, for each hazard in the given form.
If a hazard is set to 'relevant', additional information will be requested.
The additional information can be given either by typing or by speech recognition.
There is also the ability to add images, if necessary.
Once the form is filled out, the foreman sends it to the server, and receives an access code.
The foreman passes the received access code on to the other workers of the group.


### Workers

The workers receive an access code from the foreman of their group.
By inserting the access code into the app, they can view a summarized version of the hazard identification form, that displays all the hazards that have been set as relevant by the foreman.
After reading through the form, the workers can send a confirmation that they have completed the hazard identification.


### Foreman (end)

The names of workers that have completed the hazard identification are displayed on the foreman's device.
Once the foreman sees that all workers in the group have sent their confirmation, they can mark the hazard identification as completed, and begin the intended phase of work.


### Both

After a user has completed a hazard identification, they can go to the 'My observations' page and inspect the form again, if necessary.
