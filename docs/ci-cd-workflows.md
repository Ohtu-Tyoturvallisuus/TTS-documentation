# GitHub Actions Workflows for HazardHunt

This document provides an overview of the GitHub Actions workflows used in the HazardHunt project. These workflows automate key tasks such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) for both the frontend and backend components of the project. **Expo Application Services (EAS)** is used for the CD workflows of the frontend, while backend CD workflows deploy server-side applications.

---

## Frontend vs. Backend Workflows
Frontend workflows primarily focus on building and deploying the mobile app, while backend workflows manage server-side application deployment.

> - **Note:** Backend CD workflows were initially generated automatically by **Azure App Services**, which also created a GitHub Actions Secret for authentication. These workflows were then partially modified to meet the specific needs of the project.

---

## Frontend CI/CD Workflows

### The Purpose of CI Workflows
These workflows handle continuous integration tasks for the different branches, including tests and linting.
> - **Note:** All the CI workflows can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

### The Purpose of CD Workflows
These workflows handle the continuous deployment tasks for the different environments, including building and submitting the app for both iOS and Android platforms.
> - **Important:** All the CD workflows are triggered only manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

#### 1. [**CI-HazardHunt**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-main.yml)

Triggers:
- `pull_request` events on the `main` branch.

#### 2. [**CI-HazardHunt-UAT**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-uat.yml)

Triggers:
- `push` events on the `uat` branch.

#### 3. [**CI-HazardHunt-Production**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-production.yml)

Triggers:
- `push` events on the `production` branch.

#### 4. [**CD-HazardHunt**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/eas-build-submit-all.yml)

#### 5. [**CD-HazardHunt-UAT**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/eas-build-submit-all-uat.yml)

#### 6. [**CD-HazardHunt-Production**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-frontend/blob/main/.github/workflows/eas-build-submit-all-prod.yml)

## Backend CI/CD Workflows
> - **Note:** All the workflows for the backend can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

### The Purpose of CI Workflows
These workflows handle continuous integration tasks for the different branches, including tests and linting.

### The Purpose of CD Workflows
These workflows handle the continuous deployment tasks for the different environments, including building and deploying the application.
> - **Note:** Backend CD workflows were automatically generated by Azure App Services and partially modified to fit the project's needs. Azure also created a **GitHub Actions Secret** to manage authentication.

#### 1. [**CI-HazardHunt**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-main.yml)

Triggers:
- `pull_request` events on the `main` branch.

#### 2. [**CI-HazardHunt-UAT**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-uat.yml)

Triggers:
- `push` events on the `uat` branch.

#### 3. [**CI-HazardHunt-Production**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-production.yml)

Triggers:
- `push` events on the `production` branch.

#### 4. [**CD-HazardHunt**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/main_tts-app.yml)

#### 5. [**CD-HazardHunt-UAT**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/uat_tts-app-uat.yml)

#### 6. [**CD-HazardHunt-Production**](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/production_tts-app-prod.yml)

## Important notes about Azure portal

After a deployment to the backend is made, you should go to **Azure portal** 
(`portal.azure.com`), and verify that the deployment is successful.
 
If you have made a deployment from the main branch of the backend, (which 
happens automatically after merging a pull request,) navigate to the **tts-app** 
app service in the **rg-tts-dev**.

- On the overview page, you can see the status of the last deployment.

- You can observe the app service logs by navigating to **Monitoring -> Log stream**.

- Note that after deployment, it takes some time before the app service gets booted up. After a pull request has been merged and the Github Actions have completed running, it may take between 5 and 15 minutes for the app service to be running normally again.

- If you are observing the log stream after a deployment, and see a log that says something like: **Container for tts-app did not start within expected time. Terminating...**, you should do the following:

1. Navigate to **Settings -> Environment variables** 

2. Click on **WEBSITES_CONTAINER_START_TIME_LIMIT**, and increase the value

3. Navigate to **Overview** and click on **Restart**

### If you have made changes to the models.py file in the TTS-backend repository

1. In the app service, navigate to **Development tools -> Advanced Tools**

2. Click on **Go**

3. Click on **SSH**

4. Run the migrations using: 

```
python manage.py migrate
```

## Conclusion

The GitHub Actions workflows for HazardHunt automate essential CI/CD tasks, ensuring efficient validation and deployment processes for both frontend and backend components. By leveraging these workflows:
- Developers can maintain code quality through automated testing.
- Teams can confidently deploy applications to testing and production environments.
